name: shopping-aggregator
description: Use when the user wants to compare prices for a SPECIFIC product they're about to buy across multiple retailers — Amazon / eBay / Walmart / Target / Best Buy / Taobao / Tmall / JD / Pinduoduo — plus price-history sources (Keepa / Camelcamelcamel / 慢慢买) and coupon/cashback layers (Capital One Shopping / Karma / Coupert / 购物党). Triages buy intent (product + region + budget + urgency), detects available shopping MCP/extension/tool, delegates live-price fan-out to playwright/BigGo-MCP/Keepa, enforces price-specific quality guardrails (timestamp + stock + landed cost + coupon-cart verification + retailer trust tiers). Sister skill to market-intel — that one handles broad commercial / seller-side research; THIS one handles consumer-purchase price comparison. Trigger phrases: "compare prices for X", "what's the cheapest place to buy", "is this a good deal", "should I wait for a sale", "比价", "查历史价", "全网最低价", "X 在哪里买便宜", "凑单"。

# shopping-aggregator

A thin orchestration layer for consumer shopping price comparison. It does **only three things nothing
else does**: (1) parse a buy intent into a triage of the right shopping domains + channel classes; (2)
detect which specialized shopping MCP / extension / OSS tool is connected and guide installing missing
ones; (3) enforce **price-specific** guardrails (snapshot timestamp, stock state, landed-cost
normalization, coupon-cart verification, retailer trust tiers). The heavy lifting — live page fetch,
history backfill, adversarial verification, citation synthesis — is **delegated** to playwright / BigGo
/ Keepa MCPs / `deep-research` / `market-intel`. Do not re-implement those.

> **Design philosophy (governs all changes): root-cause design, not incremental patching** — fix the
> assumption underneath a problem, not the symptom on top. Full statement in `PHILOSOPHY.md`; every
> change must pass "does it fix the framing, or just patch a symptom?"

## Scope — when this skill applies, and when to stop

**Use this skill** for the consumer buy decision: "compare prices / find the cheapest place to buy X",
"is this a good deal / should I wait for a sale / what's the historical low". **Stop and delegate**
otherwise — before doing anything, route away these non-buy-decision asks:
- **Single retailer + already picked** ("just check Amazon for Bose QC45") → open the page, no workflow.
- **Bulk arbitrage / FBA sourcing / supplier discovery** → `market-intel` `ecommerce-arbitrage` shard
  (different sources — Keepa, Helium 10, alibaba — and a seller-side verifier mindset).
- **Category research / market sizing / competitive landscape / X-Twitter sentiment / SEO intel** (no
  specific product, e.g. "how big is the smart-lock market") → `market-intel`.
- **Single-fact lookup** ("what's Costco's return policy") → plain web search, no workflow.

If both apply ("buying X — also tell me what reviewers think / whether the category is declining"),
own the buy decision here and **delegate the side-research to market-intel as a sub-task**.

## Workflow
### Step 1 — Parse the buy intent (BLOCKING)

Capture all five before fanning out. **For ambiguous asks, ask the user for the missing fields first.**
Skipping this is the most common failure mode — it yields a generic landscape report instead of a buy
decision.
| field | why it changes routing |
|---|---|
| **Product** (brand+model+spec+condition) | controls SKU-level matching (new/refurb/used) |
| **Region** (US / CN / cross-border) | switches domain set: US → Amazon/eBay/Walmart/Best Buy; CN → Taobao/JD/PDD; cross-border → both + customs |
| **Budget / urgency** | "wait for sale" → Keepa/Camelcamelcamel historical-low; "need Wed" → hard-filter shipping speed |
| **Sensitivity** (warranty, refurb-OK, rating cutoff, returns) | drives trust tiers (AliExpress rating, Amazon WHD vs marketplace) |
| **Existing accounts / extensions** | use what's installed; don't recommend new tooling unless clearly worth it |

If the user said only "find me the cheapest", confirm region + condition first — cheapest "new from
authorized US seller" ≠ cheapest "any condition + any AliExpress seller."

### Step 2 — Triage (domains → channel classes → depth)

**Step 2 output you MUST produce: `[matched domains | in-scope channel classes | depth cap]`.**

#### 2a — Triage to domains
Read `reference/sources-index.md` (thin index); match the buy intent to 1–N of the 12 domains
(full list there). **Do not read full domain shards yet.** US typically → `amazon-us`,
`ebay-walmart-target`, `browser-extensions`, `mobile-apps-aggregators`, `ai-shopping-assistants`,
`claude-mcps`; CN → `taobao-tmall`, `jd-pdd`, `claude-mcps`, maybe `oss-self-host`. Historical-low
queries always add `amazon-us` (Camelcamelcamel/Keepa) or `taobao-tmall` (慢慢买).

#### 2b — Map to channel classes
Read `reference/channel-classes.md` and enumerate the authorized-retailer classes the product spans
(mass-market · category-specialist · brand-direct · warehouse · local-pickup-only · cross-border ·
refurb). This is the **demand-side** counterweight to 2a: a tool-less channel (e.g. Micro Center —
website only) is still in scope, routes to playwright / a store-specific scrape, **not skipped**. The
in-scope classes are the **coverage floor** — each must reach a real read (E1) or be a `not-attempted`
gap (guardrail #9).

#### 2c — Depth budget
Pick a depth and hold its hard caps:
| depth | max subagents | max rounds | max verifiers | use when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **quick (default)** | 3 | 1 | 1 | a single mainstream in-stock SKU, one region, no history needed |
| standard | 6 | 2 | 3 | multi-retailer "best price right now" with real channel spread |
| deep | 12 | 3 | 5 | explicit "comprehensive / 全面" or high-ticket ($500+) where execution cost > research cost |

For a single mainstream SKU the value is **landed-cost + timestamp + seller-identity check, not a full
fan-out** — `quick` is the honest default; escalate only when channel spread or ticket size earns it.
Maintain a running count; at a cap, stop fanning out and synthesize.

### Step 3 — Detect available sources (do NOT guess by tool name)

Run `claude mcp list` and parse the three-state health — usable only if `✓ Connected`; treat
`✗ Failed` / `! Needs authentication` as **not available**. Tool-name prefix matching (`mcp__*shopping*`)
is unreliable (deferred tools, plugin prefixes, dead connections distort it). Detect: **playwright MCP**
(default ④ live-fetch); **firecrawl** (static fallback, **NOT enough for Amazon/Taobao** anti-bot — use
playwright, see `reference/domains/amazon-us.md`); **BigGo MCP** (`reference/tools/biggo-mcp.md`); **Keepa MCP** (Amazon
history); **Apify price-intelligence MCP** (paid, broadest US). Also ask the user (can't auto-detect):
Camelcamelcamel bookmark, Keepa account, browser extensions (Capital One Shopping / Karma / 购物党 / 慢慢买 App).

### Step 4 — Select sources + guide install (non-blocking)

For each triaged domain read **only** its shard `reference/domains/<domain>.md`, pick the best
**available** source, and **prefer the free browser-automation route (④) over paid APIs when it
fits** — playwright reads the real Amazon / Taobao page in one shot; paid APIs (Keepa, Rainforest,
PriceAPI) earn their cost only for what playwright can't (deep history, scale, compliance). **A channel class with NO domain shard**
(brand-direct, cross-border/import, non-PC category-specialists e.g. Sephora/Crutchfield/REI) has no
shard to read — run it directly via the route in `reference/channel-classes.md` (usually ④ playwright +
that class's caveat); do NOT create a shard for it. **Never
block on install:** if the decision depends on a missing source, recommend it (command + cost in
`reference/volatile/pricing-install.md`) but **proceed this turn with a fallback + flag the gap** (a
new MCP only works after a session restart / `/mcp` reconnect). Prefer HTTP-transport on Windows
(stdio `npx`/`uvx` MCPs are flaky). L0 mechanics + secret hygiene (keys NEVER in transcript):
`reference/install-guide.md`.

### Step 5 — Delegate execution

Hand the selected sources + sub-questions to the heavy harness:
- **Per-retailer live price** → playwright MCP (one subagent/retailer; each loads the MCP via
  ToolSearch first — subagents inherit MCPs only in deferred form).
- **Multi-retailer one-shot** → BigGo MCP, else Apify price-intelligence MCP, else fan out playwright.
- **History query** → Keepa MCP / Camelcamelcamel web fetch (Amazon free) / 慢慢买 (CN).
- **Adjacent research** (reviews, brand reliability, "wait for Prime Day?") → `market-intel` /
  `deep-research`.
- **Independent cross-model crossval + channel discovery** → **Codex MCP** (`mcp__codex__*`, GPT +
  own search): discover missed channels, cross-check the cheapest pick, sanity-check authenticity.
  **Codex prices are L5 *leads*** — re-pass the live-fetch + citation gate (#1) before ranking.
  Best-effort: skip + note the gap (#9) if absent. Setup + how-to: `reference/codex-crossval.md`.

Require every subagent to return a **structured evidence unit**, not free prose — bare fields below;
full annotated schema + tiering/grade rules: `reference/evidence-schema.md` (read at Step 5):
```
status, retailer, product_match{ title, asin/itemId/skuId, variant_key, confidence },
prices[{ sticker, currency, shipping, tax_estimate, coupon_applied, cashback_estimate, landed_cost,
         stock_state, seller_name, seller_rating, condition, snapshot_ts, source_url,
         seller_tier, evidence_grade }],
history{ 90d_low, 90d_high, 365d_low, now_vs_low, source_url }|null, coupon_attempts[{ code, applied, savings }], notes
```
Length-cap each field. The main agent **reduces** these units — never reads raw page dumps; if fan-out
exceeds ~5 retailers, insert a combiner layer (each merges 3–4 workers). Then, before synthesis, spawn
the **zero-context verifier** (CONSTITUTION II.4): a fresh subagent with NO prior context that
re-fetches every cited URL backing an `E1`/`L1` price entering the ranking and independently confirms
price + stock + timestamp + **seller** (Sold-by/Shipped-by) + **evidence_grade** (a real PDP/API read,
not a snippet). Same-subagent self-verification is a bug.

### Step 6 — Normalize and rank by LANDED COST

The most-skipped step and the most decision-relevant. **Every tax / duty / shipping / FX number used
here MUST resolve to a row in `reference/data/` (carrying `source_url` + `verified_date`) or be stamped
`(assumed)` inline — CONSTITUTION I.7. Do NOT hard-code a rate or threshold from memory.**
- **Currency**: convert all to the user's region currency using the provider precedence + provenance
  schema in `reference/data/fx-source-of-record.md` (Frankfurter primary → ExchangeRate-API fallback).
  Cite the FX rate + provider + the rate's effective timestamp (not fetch time); never round silently,
  never invent a rate — if neither provider answers, leave the price in its source currency and mark
  the conversion `UNVERIFIED`.
- **Landed cost = sticker + shipping + tax + duty + (− coupon) + (− cashback).** Sticker alone is a
  ranking trap (Prime free-ship vs eBay $15 ship flips winners).
  - **Tax (US):** look up the buyer's state in `reference/data/us-sales-tax.json` (do NOT type a rate
    from memory — e.g. NJ resolves to the `NJ` row, 6.625%). Cite the row's `source_url` +
    `verified_date`. If the state is unknown, compute with the row anyway once region is confirmed at
    Step 1, or stamp the tax line `(assumed)`.
  - **Shipping:** check the retailer's free-ship baseline in `reference/data/shipping-baselines.json`
    (Amazon/Walmart/Target/Best Buy $35 non-member; eBay/AliExpress = seller-set, no platform
    baseline) before assuming "free" — sub-threshold carts add a real fee that flips rankings.
  - **Cross-border duty:** look up `reference/data/cross-border-duty.json`. **The legacy $800 US
    Section 321 de-minimis is SUSPENDED for ALL origins (EO 14324, eff 2025-08-29) — do NOT treat any
    sub-$800 cross-border parcel as duty-free.** Read the de-minimis status row + the relevant HTS
    category rate, estimate duty, and cite both rows; where no category row fits, flag `duty likely
    owed — confirm exact HTS rate at checkout` rather than assuming $0.
- **Coupons**: verify by **playwright cart test** (badges lie); mark each `code, applied?, $`.
- **Trust-adjust**: drop marketplace listings < 95% rating or < 500 ratings unless user OK'd it
  (AliExpress especially).
- **Output** the table sorted by landed cost, a "but actually" footnote on the top-2 (warranty /
  returns / shipping-speed differentiators), and an explicit history note ("$X above 90-day low / at
  365-day low / NEW LOW"; cite the Camelcamelcamel/Keepa chart when recommending "wait for sale").

**Before you emit the report, self-check** (cheap substitute for an executable gate) —
- [ ] Every ranked row carries `variant_key` + `snapshot_ts` + `seller_tier` + `evidence_grade`?
- [ ] The #1 recommendation rests on ≥2 `E1` reads of the **same `variant_key`** (not single-source)?
- [ ] A "Coverage gaps" section is present, including every in-scope channel class `not-attempted`?
- [ ] `Sold by` was read for every unit stamped `L1` (else it is `L3`, not `L1`)?
- [ ] The zero-context verifier (Step 5) actually re-confirmed each ranked `E1`/`L1` price?
- [ ] No `E3` lead is sitting in the ranking, and no two snapshots were silently averaged?

## Quality guardrails (HARD rules — apply during synthesis)

Price-data-specific extensions of the market-intel guardrails — read both together. Long-form
rationale + war-stories for #5/#5b/#7/#8/#9/#10: `reference/evidence-schema.md`.
1. **Snapshot timestamp is MANDATORY.** Every price entry carries `[fetched YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ]`
   (prices change hourly — Amazon Buy Box); one without is "unverified." State the snapshot date at
   report top.
2. **Stock state is part of the price.** Rank in-stock first; OOS / preorder = footnote, not top pick.
3. **Landed cost, not sticker.** See Step 6. Sticker-only with no computable landed cost → label
   `⚠ sticker only — actual landed cost may be higher.` Every tax/duty/shipping/FX value MUST resolve
   to a `reference/data/` row (with `source_url` + `verified_date`) or be stamped `(assumed)` — a bare
   rate or threshold typed from memory is a provenance bug (CONSTITUTION I.7).
4. **Coupon verification gate.** Don't trust "coupons available!" badges — verify via playwright cart
   test or label `coupon claims unverified` (Honey-style false positives are real; Honey 2026 status in
   `reference/domains/browser-extensions.md`).
5. **Seller tiers (L1–L5 — WHO sold it).** A DOMAIN is not proof of first-party (Best Buy / Walmart /
   Newegg / Amazon all host 3P under their own domain) — stamp **L1 ONLY after reading `Sold by` /
   `Shipped by`**; if unread, **L3, never L1**. Missing `seller_name` **degrades to L3, does NOT
   reject**. Don't rank L4/L5 winners without override; mark every tier. Defs + Run-B war-story:
   `reference/evidence-schema.md` (#5).
5b. **Evidence grade (E1/E2/E3 — HOW obtained — gates ranking FIRST, before seller_tier).** Only `E1`
   (live PDP / official API) may be a ranked winner; `E2` (aggregator) enters only with a corroborating
   `E1` of the **same `variant_key`**; `E3` (SERP / cross-model recall) is never ranked — re-fetch to
   `E1`. A first-party domain does NOT upgrade an E3 snippet. Rules: `reference/evidence-schema.md` (#5b).
6. **No silent degradation.** Falling back from Keepa to spot-only playwright → the report MUST say
   `⚠ historical data unavailable, only live price shown — cannot confirm if this is a good deal vs.
   recent floor.` Never swap silently.
7. **Disagreement = re-fetch / reconcile, never average** (procedure + war-story: `evidence-schema.md` #7):
   - (a) **Cross-snapshot** (same page, two pulls >5% apart): re-fetch a 3rd time; resolve or surface
     both with timestamps.
   - (b) **Cross-SOURCE recon** (different sources): FIRST confirm same `variant_key` (mismatched = two
     SKUs, separate, NOT a disagreement); if same-key and >5% apart, write a Disagreement-matrix row
     (cause ∈ `{different seller, stale/aggregated (E2/E3), coverage-gap}`) and resolve by grade — E1
     wins; an E2/E3 that can't be lifted corroborates or is discarded, never averaged.
8. **Disconfirmation mandate.** Run a dedicated reverse-search subagent (scam / counterfeit / fake-
   reseller / refurb-not-as-advertised / DOA) against the cheapest pick; report a "Risks &
   counter-evidence" section — empty = "actively reverse-searched, none found — not proof of safety,"
   never silence. Taxonomy + Codex option: `reference/evidence-schema.md` (#8).
9. **Failures AND never-tried become explicit gaps** (coverage floor; full rule: `evidence-schema.md` #9):
   - (a) **Failures:** any subagent returning `failed/empty` → one query rewrite + retry; if still
     empty, list in an explicit "Not covered" section.
   - (b) **Coverage floor:** an in-scope channel class (`reference/channel-classes.md`) **never
     attempted** is also a gap — record `status: not-attempted` + reason, emit a `coverage_gap` line
     (Step 7); the "Coverage gaps" section MUST list every in-scope class not taken to `E1`.
     Completeness-by-omission is a bug.
10. **Affiliate disclosure tracking (read-only).** Extensions/sites that affiliate-hijack (Honey,
    Karma, Slickdeals, smzdm) MUST NOT bias the ranking — cross-check any "save $X via our link" claim
    against the retailer's public price. Detail: `reference/evidence-schema.md` (#10).

## Output

Synthesize per `reference/report-template.md`: snapshot timestamp, parsed buy intent (for the user to
confirm), landed-cost ranked table, history note, coupon-applied list, risks & counter-evidence,
explicit coverage gaps + "configure source X for deeper data" lines, full source list.

## Close the feedback loop (Step 7 — write what you observed)

At the end of a real run, append one line per source touched to `metrics/live-runs.jsonl` (reuses
guardrail verdicts — tells the next refresh which matrix entries the world just proved right/wrong),
plus one `coverage_gap` line per IN-SCOPE channel class (`reference/channel-classes.md`) NOT taken to
E1 — this is how a missing CHANNEL (not just a dead tool) reaches the refresh loop
(`reference/refresh-protocol.md`).

```jsonc
{ "ts":"<UTC>", "domain":"amazon-us", "source":"keepa",
  "outcome":"verified|unverifiable|dead|fallback_used|price_mismatch|coupon_fake|coverage_gap",
  "detail":"<what diverged>", "user_correction": null }  // user_correction = highest-weight truth
```

Per CONSTITUTION II.5: if you can't write the file (repo not checked out / not writable), note the
observations in your reply instead — dropping them entirely is a bug.

## Recurring / monitoring use

**One-shot** — "should I buy this now and where." For "watch this and alert me below $X", point the
user to `/schedule` (cron re-run) or a native Keepa / Camelcamelcamel / 慢慢买 price alert; monitoring
+ distribution is out of scope for this thin layer (market-intel P5).

## Progressive loading rules

SKILL.md (this file) is always loaded — keep it the only frequently-loaded content. Read on-demand,
**never a whole directory**: `reference/sources-index.md` + `reference/channel-classes.md` at triage; only the matched
`reference/domains/<domain>.md`; `reference/tools/index.md` then only the picked
`reference/tools/<slug>.md`; `reference/install-guide.md` when setting up a source;
`reference/evidence-schema.md` at Step 5; the relevant `reference/data/*.json` table(s) at Step 6
landed-cost (us-sales-tax / cross-border-duty / shipping-baselines) + `reference/data/fx-source-of-record.md`
for FX; `reference/volatile/pricing-install.md` only when guiding an install (time-stamped — verify
against the official site first).

## Maintenance

The matrix decays. To "refresh the source matrix / 刷新比价工具库" or on a scheduled sweep, follow
`reference/refresh-protocol.md` (per-domain fan-out for new/changed/dead tools since each shard's
`last_verified`, apply guardrails, edit shards incrementally, diff in `CHANGELOG.md`, bump version).
Cadence: **monthly** (faster than market-intel — promo cycles + browser-extension policy churn).
